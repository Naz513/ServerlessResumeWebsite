            <div class="l-Section-content">
                <p>I am a motivated professional with 4+ years of business analysis and quality assurance experience in
                    various sectors. Recognized for demonstrating a natural aptitude for developing impactful,
                    data-driven insights, as well as for driving continuous improvement and process optimization and
                    proactively collaborating with cross-functional teams. Professional focal points include business
                    analysis, data analytics, team leadership, data-driven solutions, strategic planning, process
                    optimization, quality assurance, continuous improvement, auditing, accounting, research, data
                    validation, database design, conflict resolution, stakeholder engagement, and reporting. Delivering
                    superior administration on the latter areas of expertise requires utilization of effective
                    communication skills, critical thinking skills, as well as business acumen, regulatory compliance,
                    project management and resource management to support efficiency and maximum returns.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Currently, I am a Functional Analyst with Healthy Directions. Under my leadership, I ensure the
                    delivery of an optimal end user experience by defining and developing business requirements and
                    functional specifications. I also improve workflows and productivity by performing UAT with Zephyr
                    in JIRA. In addition, I liaise with senior leadership, stakeholders, and cross-functional teams to
                    ensure the company’s functional support structure is driving the business forward with minimal
                    expenditures.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Colleagues describe me as a progressive, driven, down-to-earth, analytical and leadership expert who
                    can be relied on to offer superior solutions that deliver impactful results on time and under
                    budget.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am interested in contacting former colleagues and managers, as well as other professionals in my
                    field. Feel free to contact me through this profile if you wish to connect.
